ABSTRACT
This project aims to build a Content-Based Recommender System for recommending restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area. Place data from Google Places API is queried to build a dataset with features such as restaurant names, ratings price-levels and reviews. The user reviews are pre-processed using NLP techniques and converted into feature vectors. The reviews are further used to extract Topics based on common themes using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model. Finally, cosine similarity is used as the evaluation metric for obtaining mathematical similarity between places and to provide top 5 recommendations.  

DESIGN
San Francisco Bay Area has more than 10k restaurant options, with over 4000 restaurants just within the city of San Francisco. With so many options available, deciding which restaurant to eat at or order from can be a nerve-wracking and tiring experience causing analysis paralysis and decision fatigue. This project uses easily-accessible Google Maps data and the power of NLP to build a recommender system that can provide personalized recommendations for restaurants based on Reviews and other factors such as price level and ratings. 

DATA
Webscraping Google Maps using Places API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service

Features are extracted from the JSON response, providing 20 Places per response. Using the Place ID, corresponding reviews are queried which outputs 5 reviews/place.
